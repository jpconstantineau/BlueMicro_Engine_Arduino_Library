A Universal Library that creates a game loop.  This can be used for any Arduino program that handles inputs, update logic as well as outputs.

Based on the book of [Game Programming Patterns by "Robert Nystrom"](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html)


# Dependencies

At this point, there are no processor dependencies.


# Examples

There are a number of examples you can use to start from.  The following examples are very similar but are tailored to specific hardware.

* `feather` - Simple test for barebones Feather boards
* `feather_neokey2` - Simple test for Feather boards with a NeoKey 2 Featherwing
* `itsybitsy` -  Simple test for ItsyBitsy boards
* `promicro` - Simple test for Boards with the form factor of a Pro Micro
* `qtpy` - Simple test for QT Py boards
* `rpipico` - Simple test for Raspberry Pi Pico
